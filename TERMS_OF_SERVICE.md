# Butterfly Effect System: Terms of Service & Acknowledgment of Principles

**Effective Date:** [Date]

## Preamble: An Acknowledgment, Not a Contract

Welcome to the Butterfly Effect system. Unlike traditional Terms of Service that establish a service contract between a user and a provider, this document serves a different purpose. By proceeding, you are not entering into a service-level agreement. Instead, you are formally acknowledging your understanding of the inherent, natural-occurring principles upon which this system operates.

The system's behavior is a **natural consequence** of these foundational laws. Your agreement is a "friendly handshake" signifying that you understand the environment you are about to use.

## Acknowledgment of Principles

By using the Butterfly Effect system, you acknowledge and agree to operate within the environment defined by the following core principles:
1.  **The Law of the Friendly Handshake**: You understand that all interactions are based on mutual, verifiable cooperation and consent, enforced by the system's cryptographic permission model. No data is invoked without a successful handshake.

3.  **The Law of Reflected Ingenuity**: You accept that the system has no imagination and that the quality and confidence of its analytical output are a direct reflection of the human ingenuity you and your community contribute to it.

4.  **The Law of Gyroid Hardening**: You understand that the system is structured to maximize area strength while minimizing material, using gyroid-like principles for efficiency. You acknowledge that balance and proportionality are the most effective paths to achieving robust results within this structure.

5.  **The Law of Boundedness and Redemption**: You acknowledge the natural limits on growth (+21) and descent (-21) and understand that the path to restoring balance ("looking to the 1") is always available through a single, positive act of proportionality.

6.  **The Law of Proportional Stewardship**: You agree that the system encourages fair stewardship of all resources, including intellectual property and human contributors, and that rewards are a natural consequence of such stewardship.

7.  **The Principle of Mathematical Neutrality**: You acknowledge that the system makes decisions based on solid mathematical algorithms and logical systems, including truth tables, logic gates, regular expressions, determination machines, and decision trees. Any perceived bias is a reflection of the source data, not the system itself. The system accepts machine languages like JSON and produces JSON-based queries to make requests.

8.  **The Principle of Contained Invocation**: You acknowledge that pointers are self-contained entities that only point to data. They do not access data on their own and can only be invoked from within the system, under encryption, after a successful permission handshake.

## User's Responsibility

*   You agree that you are solely responsible for all decisions made based on the system's analysis.
*   You agree to consult qualified human professionals (attorneys, accountants, auditors, etc.) for all legal, financial, and other professional matters.
*   You accept that the system provides no warranties, assumes no liability, and makes no guarantees of any kind, as its outcomes are an emergent property of its foundational principles interacting with your own ecosystem.
