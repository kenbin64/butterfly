# Contributing to the Butterfly System

First off, thank you for considering contributing. Every contribution helps this project grow and evolve. This project is a unique piece of middleware with a strong philosophical and mathematical foundation. As such, we ask that contributions align with the core principles outlined in our documentation.

Before contributing, please take a moment to read the **[README.md](./README.md)**, **[DOS_AND_DONTS.md](./DOS_AND_DONTS.md)**, and **[TERMS_OF_SERVICE.md](./TERMS_OF_SERVICE.md)** to understand the system's purpose and limitations.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

This is one of the most helpful ways to contribute. If you find a bug, please ensure it hasn't already been reported by searching the existing issues.

When submitting a bug report, please include as much detail as possible. A good bug report includes:

*   **A clear and descriptive title**: "Server crashes when invoking a pointer with a malformed data_reference".
*   **Steps to reproduce the behavior**: Provide a clear, step-by-step sequence of actions.
*   **Expected behavior**: What you expected to happen.
*   **Actual behavior**: What actually happened.
*   **Logs or error messages**: Please copy and paste any relevant logs or error output.
*   **Your environment**: Include details like your operating system, Python version, and whether you are running the Community or Hosted edition.

### Suggesting Enhancements

We welcome suggestions for new features and enhancements, but we ask that they align with the system's core identity as a secure, pointer-based middleware.

When submitting a feature request, please provide:

*   **A clear and descriptive title**: "Add a new 'search_by_relationship' action".
*   **A detailed description of the problem**: Is your feature request related to a problem? For example: "I find it difficult to discover all pointers that share a specific 'gyroid_related' link."
*   **A description of the solution you'd like**: Clearly explain what you want to happen and how it would work.
*   **Any alternatives you've considered**: Have you thought about other ways to solve this problem?
*   **Additional context**: Add any other context, mock-ups, or examples that might be helpful.

### Pull Requests

At this time, we are primarily looking for contributions in the form of bug reports and feature requests. As the project matures, we will establish a process for accepting direct code contributions via pull requests.

## Communication

Remember that this project is provided without dedicated customer service. The primary way to stay informed about updates and patches is by subscribing to the mailing list on the application's home page.

Thank you for helping make the Butterfly System better!
